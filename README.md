# Gallery

A simplistic photo gallery app built using Angular 4.
I created this application as a learning exercise and made a YouTube video showing how I built it. 
You can check that video out here: https://youtu.be/V5-CIZTLyvw

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
